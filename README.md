# MazeVerse


It is a maze game where the player is essentially left in, and the aim is to get to the final cell. So dig deep in this amazing world of mazes and create your own with random maze generator provided in the game.

To run this in Unity you will need to install Cinemachine.

After building with Unity (version 2019.4.8f1), copy the folder "Assets/Mazes" into the folder "MazeVerse_Data" in the build directory.
